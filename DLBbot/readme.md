These are the individual bots for Dragon Ball Legends (game) that I made, I made them just to test out my abilites and check how will the game react with my bots, I'm not trying 
make the game harder for others ( or easier )

If you are using these bots then beware, and don't blame me if something goes wrong or something happens 

Just have a good time.
